        The project aims to build a web application that analyzes and processes
        document files such as Word, Excel, and CSV for lawyer use. Initially, it will use a
        Python backend to efficiently handle data extraction and analysis,
        leveraging Python's robust libraries for document processing. The
        application will feature a responsive React frontend for file upload and
        interaction, ensuring smooth user experiences. Data from the processed
        files will be stored in a database, enabling dynamic updates,
        in-app visualization, and export options, such as generating Excel
        reports. In the future, you plan to incorporate Node.js into the backend
        architecture for enhanced performance, scalability, and real-time
        updates, potentially adopting a hybrid approach for workload
        distribution and optimized processing using a message broker.
